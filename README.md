# Hello Everyone!👋

My name is Eren Janberk Genç. I'm currently in my last year at Boğaziçi University, Turkey. I am really passionate about data visualization and everything related to data.

The portfolio repository is where my data analysis and visualization projects are housed temporarily while i am working on a better version. To see the GitHub pages version, please follow [this link.](#)

I hope that you'll find something to your liking in my Github!
