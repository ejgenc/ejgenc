### Analysis & Visualization Projects
- **[Seeking Traces of the Translator's Invisibility in Goodreads Reviews](https://github.com/ejgenc/data-analysis_goodreads_translation_reviews)** -- My Bachelor's graduation project. I gather, clean, analyze, visualize and write about a corpus of translation reviews from the social book cataloging website Goodreads in an attempt to find support for a Translation Studies theory called "The Translator's Invisibility."
- **[A Tribute to My Wrongness: How Health Tourism Interacts with Airbnb Rents in Istanbul](https://github.com/ejgenc/data-analysis_istanbul-health-tourism)** -- An open data analysis & visualization project in which i try to figure out whether proximity to health tourism services affects the prices of Airbnb rentals in Istanbul.
- **[An Exercise in Open Data: Mapping Istanbul’s Health Services](https://github.com/ejgenc/data-analysis_istanbul-health-services-Map)** -- Using open data, I try to see whether or not there is an underlying inequality in the way Istanbul's health services are distributed.

### Creative Coding
- **Color Blooms**(WIP) -- An interactive creative coding project where the user can play with the given parameters and randomization to create a canvas of blooming colors.
