# Hello Everyone!ðŸ‘‹

## Who am i?
My name is Eren Janberk GenÃ§. I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. I still reside there and I'm currently studying my last year at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University.

## What do i work on?
I am really passionate about engaging with open data through data visualization and storytelling. Visual representations of data in all forms captivate and interest me. I'm trying to gradually get better at data analysis, visualization and storytelling.

## Where can you find my work?
The portfolio repository is where my data analysis and visualization projects are housed temporarily while i am working on a better version. To see the GitHub pages version of my portfolio, please follow [**this link.**](https://ejgenc.github.io/portfolio/)
