# Hello Everyone!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eren Janberk GenÃ§. I'm currently in my last year at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University, Turkey. I am really passionate about data visualization and everything related to data.

The portfolio repository is where my data analysis and visualization projects are housed temporarily while i am working on a better version. To see the GitHub pages version of my portfolio, please follow [this link.](https://ejgenc.github.io/portfolio/)

I hope that you'll find something to your liking in my Github!
